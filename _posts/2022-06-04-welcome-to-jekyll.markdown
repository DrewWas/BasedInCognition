In computing, a virtual machine is a virtual computer running inside another computer. A virtual machine's storage, operating system, and memory are completely independednt from the computer it is running within. A VM can be imagined as a completely parallel computing system, that is leeching compute power and user interface through another, physical machine. VMs are of great use to when testing new software, or using potentailly malicoious/dangerous software because, if the VM is hacked, backdoored, corrupted, etc. it can simply be deleted from the host machine, and all software hosted by the original machine will remain unchanged and unaccesible to hackers.

^ Clean up explanation and go into more depth. Include links. 

- Apply to brains

- HOW HOW HOW 

- Connect to how humans function as agent and robot and, by using virtual brains, we could live forever. I want to make a subsection of "Applications" to put this under

- Basically just a brain in a VAT, from a more modern perspective

* FUCK SP!!!

## Segments (questions to answer)

# What is a virtual machine (in computing)?

# Where, When, and Why are virtual machines used?

# Connecting this idea to brains under the framework of neurotech

# Uses for virtual brains in neurotech (Applications)
    - Testing new drugs

# How - approaches to creating virtual brains
    - Stem cells

# Connecting these brains to our own
    - Counterargument: at this point why grown bio based brains?
