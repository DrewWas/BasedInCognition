In computing, a virtual machine is a virtual computer running inside another computer. A virtual machine's storage, operating system, and memory are completely independednt from the computer it is running within. A VM can be imagined as a completely parallel computing system, that is leeching compute power and user interface through another, physical machine. VMs are of great use to when testing new software, or using potentailly malicoious/dangerous software because, if the VM is hacked, backdoored, corrupted, etc. it can simply be deleted from the host machine, and all software hosted by the original machine will remain unchanged and unaccesible to hackers.
